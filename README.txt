Project 2: Deploy a high-availability web app using CloudFormation

Student Name: Okpara Kenneth Chinonso

Description: 
The project is required to create a networking infrastructure, virtual machines, and file storage system in order to upload and test a web application. 

In this project i developed an infrastructure diagram which acted as a visual aid to understand the CloudFormation script i want to create.

I created 4 Cloud Formation scripts (4 Templates & 4 Parameters) and supporting bash scripts in order to simply create whole infrastructure whenever its needed, and after the job is done, to easily discard it.
